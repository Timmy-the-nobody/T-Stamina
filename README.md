# t-stamina

This is a simple stamina script that can be used on most gamemodes, but was mainly designed for roleplay and survival gamemodes. It includes:
- A simple HUD, that can be disabled
- Many ways to lose stamina, most can be disabled
- Sprint/jump/crouch/punch restrictions on exhaust

## 📦 Installation
- Download LuaRun and add it in the `/Server/Packages/` folder on your server

## 🛠️ Configuration
- Edit the script to your liking by going to [`t-stamina/Shared/Config.lua`](https://github.com/Timmy-the-nobody/T-Stamina/blob/main/Shared/Config.lua), each line is commented so you'll know what you're editing.
